In this project, we are going to teach you making awesome electronics project ideas. It is called music dancing light. It is n awesome electronics project ideas. The project is about music activated led light project. The led light can dance with music, clap, air or any kind of sound.

To make this project we use some electronics component and use only DC -12v power supply. For power supply you also can use 12v battery. You can use this project as a like school or college project or any kind of cultural program.


To make this music activated light, we might need some electronics component. Those component list have to been given below.


Component List : 
1. PCB Board
2. Transistor – BC 547
3. Resistor – 100  KΩ
		          100   Ω
		          10   KΩ
		      	   1   MΩ
4. Capacitor - 470µf/ 25v
5. LED – 5mm
6. MIC
7. Power Supply – DC 12v
8. Soldering Iron


Transistor Pinout - 

BC 547 - It is an NPN transistor. As usual the transistor BC 547 also contain 3 leg & this 3 leg’s also have 3 different names. If we count it’s leg from left side, then 1no “Collector”. 2no “Base ” & 3no “Emitter”

Connect Transistor With PCB

To make this circuit, 1st we connect transistor with the circuit. We connect both transistor emitter and connect one transistor base with another transistor collector leg.
Connect Capacitor With Circuit

Now we connect 470µf/ 25v capacitor with the circuit. We connect capacitor negative leg with right side transistor base leg and this time we don’t connect capacitor positive leg with another component.

Connect Resistor With Circuit-

1st we connect 100 KΩ resistor with right side transistor collector leg and it’s other terminal with 10 KΩ resistor. Then connect 10 KΩ resistor other terminal with the capacitor positive leg.
Then we connect 1 MΩ resistor with the circuit. We connect this resistor with right side transistor base leg and it’s other terminal with 100 Ω resistor.

Connect LED Lights-

To get awesome effect, we use 8 piece 5mm LED light. We divide in two side and make a series connection between two side LED light. Then connect both LED negative leg with left side transistor collector leg.

 Connect MIC With Circuit - 
 
Since it’s a music activated light, for that we need a MIC to make this project circuit. We connect MIC positive leg with the capacitor positive leg and connect MIC negative leg with both transistor emitter leg.

Soldering And Cleaning - 

Neat and perfect soldering is an important part for all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection. After soldering all leg, we cut-off the extra leg of all electronics component.

Connect Power Supply - 

For power supply, we are using DC 12v. You can use 12v battery or can use the power supply, that can provide DC 12v. Be careful about the power supply, because if you use more than 12v , then led light will blown away and transistor may damaged.

Final Action - 

Our circuit, is now completely ready for use. Now just place the MIC beside a music system and enjoy the awesome effect . Again thanks to JLCPCB for best quality PCBs.
